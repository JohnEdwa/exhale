##Features
- A circle animation expands and contracts to help visualize and focus on breathing.
- Gentle vibrations allow users to use the app even if they are not looking at the screen.
- The background colour, circle colour, and whether to enable vibrations are all selectable by the user.

##Issues and Plans:
- Change the upper text from being fixed to my name.
- Change the bottom text to make it shorter and more descriptive.
- Add a little reminder every few hours for the user to breathe.
- Make the app more modular. It's currently in one window file, which is really big.
