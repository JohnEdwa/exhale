##Features
- A circle animation expands and contracts to help visualize and focus on breathing.
- Gentle vibrations allow users to use the app even if they are not looking at the screen.
- The background colour, circle colour, and whether to enable vibrations are all selectable by the user.
- The main screen displays how many steps the user has taken today, as well as how many minutes they have breathed using this app.

##Issues and Plans:
- Add a little reminder every few hours for the user to breathe.
- Integrate heart rate monitoring into the top part of the screen, and give the user the option to use heart rate or steps if they are both available.
