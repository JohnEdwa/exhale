##Features
- A circle animation expands and contracts to help visualize and focus on breathing.
- Gentle vibrations allow users to use the app even if they are not looking at the screen.
- The background colour, circle colour, and whether to enable vibrations are all selectable by the user.
- The main screen displays how many steps the user has taken today, as well as how many minutes they have breathed using this app.
- A reminder can be set (every 2, 4, or 6 hours) as a prompt to breathe.
- If there is a heart rate monitor on the watch, current heart rate is shown at the top part of the screen, and the user has the option to display heart rate or steps if they are both available.
- Supports English, French, and Spanish (text in app, settings page all correspond to the watch's chosen language).

##Issues and Plans:
- More languages.
